# SSNI-shiny
Shiny app for sample size in non-inferiority trial with multiplicative and additive margin. 
The sample size calculation is available for normal, poisson and binomial distribution. 
It returns sample size for treatment and control, efficiency compared to 1:1 and randomization ratio.
The plot of efficiency helps determine efficiency with different sample size in control. 

## The app is available at http://www.statlab.wisc.edu/shiny/SSNI/
